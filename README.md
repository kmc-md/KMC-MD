# How does it work?

Our framework leverages MD to maintain a Boltzmann distribution of states, and KMC to model reactions and structural changes efficiently. Integrating high-resolution techniques such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) with KMC is crucial for accurately maintaining the system in thermodynamically relevant configurations on its potential energy surface (PES).  On the other hand, atomistic MD simulations, while detailed, are limited by the short time steps (1 fs = 10-15 s) to accurately capture atomic vibrations, in that way restricting simulations to microseconds.32 Overall, the inherent limitations of MD necessitate a combination with KMC to both preserve the atomic-scale detail and extend the simulation timescales significantly (10^3 â€“ 10^6 s).

# Instructions for Running KMC-MD Simulation:
This script was created for the execution of Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) coupled with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, for studying the dehydrochlorination (DHC) process of PVC. 

Key Configuration Parameters:
1. PVC chains are differentiated by chain length using the following residue names:
   - PVA for N=5, PVB for N=20, PVC for N=40, PVD for N=60, PVE for N=100, PVF for N=120.
   Additional residue names include NAS (sodium), OH (hydroxide), NAC (sodium chloride), and SOL (water).

2. Simulation Temperature and Initial Structure file: 
  - Set the simulation temperature (in Kelvin) at line 66 and the initial structure (npt.gro) at line 174.

3. Reaction Rate Catalog: 
  - Edit reaction rates between lines 149-161.

4. Cutoff Radius for Rate Calculation: 
  - Adjust the cutoff radius (in Angstroms) for rate calculations at line 166.

5. Forcefield Atom Types: 
  - Modify the [atomtypes] section of the forcefield.itp file at line 1236 as required.

6. Initial NaOH Molecules: 
  - Edit the initial number of NaOH molecules at line 1518.

7. Iteration settings: 
   - Set the maximum number of iterations at line 1521.
   - Define the rate threshold (in /s) below which the simulation halts at line 1522.

8. Initial number of PVC Chains: 
   - Edit the initial count of PVC chains at line 1525.

9. Simulation Directory: 
  - Assign the base directory for simulation output at lines 1528 and 1545.

10. % DHC Calculation: 
   - Adjust the calculation method for % DHC at line 1644.

11. MD Execution: 
    - Adjust the commands for the MD simulation between lines 1354 and 1383
    - Set the frequency of MD stage execution relative to KMC stages at line 1653. 
      e.g. 'if iteration % 1 == 0' signifies MD stage execution after every KMC stage.

Ensure that all modifications align with the specific requirements of your simulation.
